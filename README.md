6 - Example 
 
  - Business problem
 
  - Blinkit, a rapidly growing player in the quick commerce space, has experienced significant operational and branding changes since its inception. However, there is limited visibility into how its sales have performed over the years, how consistent its growth has been, and what periods have driven the most revenue.
The key business challenge is to analyze historical sales performance, identify growth trends, and determine average yearly sales to better understand the brand's trajectory. These insights are crucial for evaluating strategic decisions, investment opportunities, and future scaling potential.
